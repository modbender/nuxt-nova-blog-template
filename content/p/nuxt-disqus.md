Nuxt Disqus provides a wrapper for [vue3-disqus](https://github.com/modbender/vue3-disqus) to be used with Nuxt 3

## Features

- üîÜEasy to integrate
- ‚ö°Ô∏èInstantly usable components `DisqusComments` and `DisqusCount`

## Quick Setup

   pnpm add -D nuxt-disqus

   # Using yarn
   yarn add --dev nuxt-disqus

   # Using npm
   npm install --save-dev nuxt-disqus
   ```

2. Add `nuxt-disqus` to the `modules` section of `nuxt.config.ts`

   ```js
   export default defineNuxtConfig({
     modules: ["nuxt-disqus"],
     disqus: {
       shortname: "your-disqus-shortname",
     },
   });
   ```

3. Place `DisqusComments` anywhere in your app to render Disqus Comment thread for particular `identifier`

   ```jsx
   <DisqusComments identifier="/blog/1" />
   ```

   ```jsx
